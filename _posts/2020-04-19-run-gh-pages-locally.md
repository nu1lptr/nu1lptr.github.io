title: Run gh-pages branch locally in WSL
---

Running `gh-pages` locally is straight forward and easy.

The official documentation explains it very well:

- https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

This post is a reminder to myself to easily find this documentation again.

Cheers â˜º
